This article is the 2nd part of [Hello World with Exstream](/hello-world-with-exstream). It describes how to create a basic communication completely from scratch.

We must provide the details of our communication:

 - Click on `Create` button
 
 A couple of designs , **Pages** (pdf) and **Emails** (e-mail), are added automatically due to the two outputs that we have created previously and included in our communications set.
