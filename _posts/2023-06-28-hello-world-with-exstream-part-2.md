This article is the 2nd part of [Hello World with Exstream](/hello-world-with-exstream). It describes how to create a basic communication completely from scratch. 
We'll create a communication design of the mythical Hello World! with **Exstream**.

> Please, see [Hello World with Exstream (1st Part)](/hello-world-with-exstream)

You just need to follow the steps described in the coming sections.

We must provide the details of our communication:

Now click on `Create` button.
 
A communication can be composed of one or more documents. So, now we are going to add a new document.

 - Click on `(+)` icon
 - Provide the details for your new document
    - **Name**: HelloWorld
    - **Description**: My First Exstream communication (PDF and e-mail)

 ![New Communication. New document](../images/2023-06-28-hello-world-with-exstream/27-exstream-new-communication-new-document.png) 
 
 - Click on `Create` button
 
 A couple of designs , **Pages** (pdf) and **Emails** (e-mail), are added automatically due to the two output that we have created previously included in our communications set.
 
 - Click on `Pages`	
 - Click on `(+)` icon
 - Provide the properties for the new desing:
    - **Name**: HelloWorldPage
    - **Paper type**: A4
